# Spoon Builder

This script copies files to the RailsBridge Boston USB drives. If you're
on a Mac, run:

    ./build-spoons

On Linux, pass the path to where your USB drives are mounted:

    ./build-spoons /media/usb0 /media/usb1 # etc...

# Adding new USB drives to the collection

New drives should be formated with a name starting with `RBB` and then a
number.

# Updating files for the next workshop
